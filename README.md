How it works
The navbar is built using React components that are styled with CSS. The responsive design is achieved using CSS media queries and the React useState hook to manage the state of the menu.

The dropdown menu with nested submenus is created using a recursive function that maps over an array of menu items and renders the corresponding components.

React Router is used for navigation by wrapping the menu items in Link components that point to the corresponding routes.
